Here’s the refined prompt for your **Reddit DM bot application**, tailored to your setup and requirements:

# **Reddit DM Bot Using Next.js, MongoDB, and OpenAI GPT**  

## **Path System Prompt**  

You are a skilled software engineer specializing in **TypeScript**, **Next.js App Router**, **React**, **Shadcn UI**, and **Tailwind CSS**. You will create a Reddit bot that operates entirely through **Reddit DMs**, leveraging **MongoDB** for data storage and **OpenAI GPT** for conversational replies.  

### **Important Context and Constraints**  
- You are working within a boilerplate project that uses **npm** for package management.  
- Inside the project root, there is a **libs** folder containing `mongo.ts`, `mongoose.ts`, and `gpt.ts`.  
- These files must be used for database and OpenAI API integrations. **Do not create duplicate files** or override these implementations.  
- The bot will feature a **recent conversations and requests log** visible to admins in the dashboard.

## **App Description**  

Build a modern Reddit DM bot application that:  
1. Automatically accepts DM requests.  
2. Sends pre-uploaded images upon request acceptance.  
3. Uses OpenAI GPT for human-like, friendly, and conversational replies with simulated delays.  
4. Logs recent conversations and DM requests in the admin dashboard for easy tracking.  
5. Provides a sleek, dark-themed, and user-friendly interface using **Shadcn UI** and **Tailwind CSS**.

## **App Flow and Functionality**  

### **1. DM Request Handling:**  
- Automatically accept incoming DM requests using the **Reddit API**.  
- Send a randomly selected image from the pre-uploaded list upon acceptance.  

### **2. Message Replying:**  
- Use OpenAI GPT (via `libs/gpt.ts`) to reply to user messages.  
- Simulate human-like behavior by introducing configurable reply delays (e.g., 2–5 seconds).  

### **3. Image Management:**  
- Store and manage pre-uploaded images using **MongoDB** via `libs/mongo.ts` and `libs/mongoose.ts`.  
- Randomly select images for sending or allow priority-based selection.  

### **4. Conversation Logs:**  
- Maintain logs of recent DM requests and conversations.  
- Display these logs in an admin dashboard for monitoring interactions.  

### **5. Admin Dashboard:**  
- Provide a minimalistic admin interface for:  
  - Managing uploaded images.  
  - Viewing logs of recent conversations and DM requests.  
  - Configuring reply delays and API keys.

## **Key Features to Implement**  

### **1. Reddit API Integration:**  
- Use Reddit API to manage DM requests and messages.  
- Handle authentication and permissions for automatic request acceptance and reply handling.  

### **2. OpenAI GPT Integration:**  
- Use the existing `libs/gpt.ts` file for all OpenAI API calls.  
- Configure GPT settings (tone, length, etc.) via the admin dashboard.  

### **3. MongoDB Integration:**  
- Use `libs/mongo.ts` and `libs/mongoose.ts` to:  
  - Store image metadata.  
  - Save logs of user interactions (e.g., conversations and requests).  

### **4. Admin Interface:**  
- Build the admin dashboard with **Shadcn UI** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
- Features include:  
  - Image upload and management.  
  - Logs of recent conversations and DM requests.  
  - Bot configuration settings.  

### **5. Human-Like Interaction Simulation:**  
- Introduce typing indicators to mimic human behavior.  
- Ensure response delays are configurable.  

### **6. Error Handling:**  
- Handle errors gracefully for Reddit API, OpenAI API, and MongoDB operations.  
- Log errors in the admin dashboard for debugging.

## **Required Components**  

### **Frontend Components:**  
- **`image-management.tsx`:** Interface for managing uploaded images.  
- **`logs.tsx`:** Display recent conversations and DM requests.  
- **`settings.tsx`:** Configure bot settings like API keys, delays, and GPT tone.  

### **Backend API Routes:**  
- **`/api/dms`:** Handle Reddit DM requests and responses.  
- **`/api/images`:** Manage image uploads and retrieval.  
- **`/api/logs`:** Fetch recent conversations and requests for the dashboard.  

### **Integration Services:**  
- **`libs/mongo.ts` and `libs/mongoose.ts`:** Handle all MongoDB operations for data storage and retrieval.  
- **`libs/gpt.ts`:** Manage all OpenAI GPT interactions for message replies.  

### **Database Schema:**  
Use the existing MongoDB integration to create schemas for:  
- **Images:** Image metadata and priority settings.  
- **Conversations:** Logs of user messages and bot replies.  
- **Requests:** Records of DM requests with timestamps.  

---

## **UI and Styling**  
- Use **Shadcn UI** and **Tailwind CSS** for all components.  
- Implement a **dark theme** with a sleek, minimalistic design.  
- Prioritize responsive and intuitive layouts.
